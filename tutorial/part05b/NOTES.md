# part 5 notes

## program counter-relative stuff

I think I am starting to see the gist of the author's approach:

The idea  is to have a  variable, stored in  the symbol table (yet  to be
introduced in the  tutorial), and we'd be getting an  offset via an `LEA`
instruction.

## dummy code

There's a lot  of skeleton code (author calls it  "dummy code"), which is
very  light on  details. Mainly  just establishing  the functionality  to
call, but doesn't yet do the deed.

There's  absolutely  **nothing**  yet done  with  *conditions*,  although
apparently there is indication part 6 of the tutorial deals with this, so
that unknown will hopefully be resolved before too much longer.
